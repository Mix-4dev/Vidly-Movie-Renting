## App Description

### I finish this app after 27 days of learning Node so I hope I can go further and I follow the standards of Building Maintainable Routes

The service helps users to choose a genre for movies they wanna rent and its super simple app and I tend to use the ***COMMON-JS way*** or writing my codebase you will notice for example I use the `require()` function for importing, `module.exports`for exporting and the usual function declaration syntax

The future enhancements is using mongoDB for DB integration and apply Authentication & Authorization
